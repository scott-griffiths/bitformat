`bitformat <https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitformat/>`_ is a Python module for creating and parsing file formats, especially at the bit rather than byte level.

It is intended to complement the `bitstring <https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitstring>`_ module.

.. warning::
    This library is in the early planning stages.
    The API will be very unstable and I do not recommend its use for anything serious.

    I am hoping to make a first proper release later in 2024.
