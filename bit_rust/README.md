**bit-rust** is a Python wrapper around a simple Rust library for basic manipulation of binary data.

It's mostly an opportunity for me to learn some Rust, but the plan is to use it to speed up the 
internals of the [**bitformat**](https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitformat) Python library.

It's not meant to be general purpose, and probably won't even be very fast for quite some time.
